**Django Rainbow** 
--------
* * * 
**`charm name: django-rainbow`**

*Django-rainbow* is designed to deploy many different Django projects
to the cloud with end-users at the helm. Any Django project which resides
on a mercurial hosted repository can be deployed using this charm.
Django-rainbow is a solid tool to deploy and redeploy your projects. You project database, users, and settings, will never be removed or over-written. A config change to django-rainbow will not take your web site offline for even a second. In fact, after your project is configured, your app can be updated or error fixed by re-triggering the config-changed hook. There are no packages to install on your client for use.


**Use:**
>Download Django-rainbow with *charm-get django-rainbow*  
>Deploy the charm with juju as a service with a *juju deploy --repository=. local:precise/django-rainbow*   
>Edit the *config.yaml* file for any django-rainbow customizations
>Edit the secondary yaml file to suit your project. This file is called
*your-project.yaml* by default.
>The renamed *your-project.yaml* file is deployed with 
*juju set django-rainbow --config precise/django-rainbow/your-project.yaml*
* * *

Deployment of your projects require editing a config file. You will need to create an unique copy of this config file (*your-project.yaml*) for each Django project you plan to use and deploy. Edit this to represent your Django project. The project must reside on a hosted third party server, e.g. Bit Bucket. When the config file is set, the config-changed hook will,
>- create or update the virtual host provided in the stripe *your-project.yaml* file  
>- add your virtual host to the Apache2 sites-available directory
>- pull or update the project from the hosted repository to the directory listed as your DocumentRoot in the virtual host
>- parse your *settings.py* file for project settings
>- create the database, user, and other settings in mysql and run a *python manage.py syncdb* command

**Explanation:**
> **config.yaml**:   
This file is the primary settings for django-rainbow. Any project configuration
settings set in this file will be permanent. It is reasonable to include project settings in here if there is to be only on project per instance. If you wish to launch many Django projects per instance, the *your-project.yaml* file is recommended.

>**your-project.yaml**:
   All settings in this file relate to a specific Django project repository. It is expected to rename and store this file separate from the charm. One can keep many of these yaml files handy to launch or update live Django projects.
   


**Tips:**  
*1)* Make sure that when the project repository is pulled onto the server, the         DocumentRoot directory listed in the virtual host is the base directory of the project. This may require changing the project repository directory structure or virtual host settings a bit.    
*2)* Do not edit any repository data on the instance.  The project should only be
updated by a config-changed trigger. This is what the revision setting is for in the *your-project.yaml* file.  
*4)* Your project can updated by increasing the revision number in this file. Another *juju set django-rainbow --config /path/to/your-project.yaml* will trigger the config-changed hook.   
*3) Don't forget to use a *juju expose django-rainbow* command to make it public and associate an ip address to the machine with aws management.

**LIMITATIONS:**
Django Rainbow is still very new so don't expect too many options as of now.  
*1)* Currently it only supports Mercurial and Bit bucket for project code hosting.  
*2)* The only supported database is mysql.
