  Django-rainbow is a primary service charm for other generic charms ussing the "stripe" template. Each of these stripes
  will contain basic informatin on seperate Django projects at the clients host. This will provide an easy way to launch
  your Django projects to the cloud and maintain them individually with juju on a single instance. If a stipe relationship is removed from
  django-rainbow, all of the database settings and project code is removed leaving all other Django projects active. Mainly for development
  needs and testing grounds but can be used to deploy and maintain many sites proffesionally.
